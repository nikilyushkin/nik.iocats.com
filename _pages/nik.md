## ðŸ‘†That's me, laying toward the desired destination.

Hey, I'm Nik Ilyushkin. Iâ€™m a Product Manager at [Roam Creative](https://weareroam.com). Starting my career at [VEON](https://www.veon.com), I had a chance to participate in the biggest telco's M&A in Russia, lead an OSS transformation at [Rostelecom](https://www.company.rt.ru/en/) and [MGTS](https://mgts.ru), and then join [Sberbank](https://www.sberbank.ru/en/) as a Head of Product in Customers Relashions. Currently my team is working on Open Banking initiative connecting the consumers, New Zealand traditional financial institutions, and developers.

Iâ€™m an active mentor startups and individuals interested in Agility and Product thinking.

My areas of expertise: fintech / b2c products / strategy / team culture / enterprise agility.

This blog is my pet project built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), helping me to write more in public and categorise best resources on product management and agile software development.
